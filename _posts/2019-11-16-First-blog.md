Last summer me and my girlfriend went to Grece, Crete together. It was really fun and was the first time i went without my family. We were there for a week and we had a 4 star hotel in Dar√°tsos, it was next to Chania. they had 3 big pools in the hotel and we got the best view straight dont to the ocean from our room.
