  We have allways had a pet in my family, if it wasn't a cat or dog it was guinea pig, but i love dogs personlly. A few years ago we had a cat called Sotan. We adopted him into our family because were he lived befor us he was abused, they had alot of young children who locked him in wardrobes so he could go to his catbox, they hurt him and it ended with them giving Sotan to us. But he never really recovered from his past so in his later years we let him go to peace. We also have always had a dog called Lillan, we named her after that because she was so small my father could fit her in his hand. Her rase is an english labrador and she is 13 years old.
